Comments= <<EOT
- Rename scripts/parse.file.pl to scripts/parse.html.pl
- Ship scripts/parse.xhtml.pl
- Ship t/Data.pm to read in test data from t/data/
- Rewrite t/*.t to use t/Data.pm
- Patch Simple.pm to accept xhtml as a parameter to new
- Patch Simple.pm to use xhtml in a few of places. XHTML support is not finished!
- Patch Simple.pm to use accessors for object attributes as per PBP. Specifically:
get/set_*() for current_node depth input_dir node_type output_dir root verbose xhtml
- Hence rename root() to get_root()
- Hence rename verbose() to get_verbose()
- Rename new_node() to create_new_node() since that makes more sense when using get/set_*()
- There are no methods get_result() and set_result(). The reason is efficiency. If we had
$self -> set_result($self -> get_result() + '<tag>') it would mean duplicating the result so far
each time a few chars were added
- Ship various tests with data for XHTML
- Add depth to the hashref of data for each tag's node in the tree
- Put the code in github: git://github.com/ronsavage/html--parser--simple.git
